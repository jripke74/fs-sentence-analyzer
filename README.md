# fs-sentence-analyzer

In this workshop, you'll review how to work with JavaScript loops by building a sentence analyzer app.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will build a sentence analyzer that will take a sentence and get the count for the number of words, vowels, consonants, and punctuation marks.

To begin, create a getVowelCount function with a parameter called sentence. Your function should return the total number of vowels in a sentence.

Step 2
Now it is time to test your getVowelCount function.

Create a vowelCount variable and assign it the result of calling the getVowelCount function with the argument of "Apples are tasty fruits"

After that, log the following to the console: "Vowel Count: [vowel count goes here]". Replace  [vowel count goes here] with the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the + operator here.

Step 3
It's time to count the consonants. Create a getConsonantCount function with a sentence parameter.

Inside the function, use a loop to count the number of consonants in the sentence that will be passed into the function when it is called. A consonant is any letter that is not one of the following characters: "aeiou".

Your getConsonantCount function must return a number.

Step 4
Now it is time to test your getConsonantCount function.

Create a consonantCount variable and assign it the result of calling the getConsonantCount function with the argument of "Coding is fun"

After that, log the following to the console: "Consonant Count: [Consonant count goes here]". Replace  [Consonant count goes here] with the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the + operator here.

Step 5
You should count the number of punctuations now.

Create a getPunctuationCount function with a sentence parameter.

Inside the function, create a loop to count the number of punctuation characters in the sentence that will be passed into the function when it is called. For our purposes, a punctuation character is any character that is not a space (" ") or a letter.

Your getPunctuationCount function must return a number.

Step 6
Now it is time to test your getPunctuationCount function.

Create a punctuationCount variable and assign it the result of calling the getPunctuationCount function with the argument of "WHAT?!?!?!?!?"

After that, log the following to the console: "Punctuation Count: [Punctuation count goes here]". Replace  [Punctuation count goes here] with the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the + operator here.

Step 7
Finally, count the number of words by creating a getWordCount function with a sentence parameter. The function should return the total number of words in the sentence passed in when it is called.

Step 8
Test your getWordCount by creating a wordCount variable set to the calling of the getWordCount function with the sentence "I love freeCodeCamp".

After that, log the following to the console: "Word Count: [Word count goes here]". Replace  [Word count goes here] with the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the + operator here.

With that, your sentence analyzer project is done!
